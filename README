    README file for Assignment 2 - HTTP Proxy

           Name:	Jayant Gupta 
      Roll No. :	10012319
     Department:	Mathematics & Computing 
 
================================================================

HOW TO USE THE PROXY
====================
1. Copy all the files in one directory.

2. On the terminal:
	~$ cd <path-to-code>
	~$ make all
	~$ ./proxy <port_number>

   --> The server should start listening for connections on the specified port.

3. Connect to the server using telnet or web-client (like web-browser).
4. Send a HTTP request, like: GET http://intranet.iitg.ernet.in/ HTTP/1.0
5. The headers and HTML of IITG Intranet Web-homepage will be displayed on the terminal screen.

EXIT THE SERVER
================
* You can exit the server by simply using Ctrl + C.

LIMITATIONS
===========
* It does not handle concurrent requests, only sequential requests.
* Only “GET” method is implemented.
* Only HTTP/1.0 requests are generated (though it accepts HTTP/1.1 requests as well).
* Connection: keep-alive not implemented.

FEATURES
========
* Accepts “GET” requests. Otherwise, responds back with a "501 Not Implemented" error.
* Flexibility in choosing the server port for the server.
* Accepts all the available formats for HTTP headers. If something goes wrong, responds with a "400 Bad Request" error.
* Works with HTTP/1.0 Also accepts HTTP/1.1 requests, but forwards the request to Web-server with HTTP version 1.0.
* Closes the client and remote server connection after a request is complete.
* Parses the given HTTP request, extarcts the hostname & Port, separates different header fields into a vector of  <Header Name, Header Value>.
* Validates the HTTP Header as well as report error to client.
* Always sends the request to Web-Server in relative path format.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=======================
I. proxy.cpp is the main file & implements the http_proxy as follows:
 	
	1.  Creates a Socket and binds it to a port --> specified as cmd-line argument.
	2.  Starts listening on the socket.
	3.  Accept connect from the client.
	4.  Receive HTTP request from the Client.
	5.  Parses/Tokenizes the HTTP Header and Checks for errors & unsupported methods. If Error in request, send the error to client.
	6.  Extracts the hostname from HTTP Header and establishes a connection over a new socket with the Web-server. 
	7.  Makes a HTTP request to the server, the HTTP Packet being in Relative path format.
	8.  Receive HTTP Response from web-server.
	9.  Forward the Response to the client. 
	10. Close the connection with client. (Web-server automatically closes connection)
	11. Wait for new connection and Goto Step 3.

II. http_header_util.cpp & http_header_util.h 
	* These files defines the class HTTPHeader and its member functions.
	* The main purpose of the HTTPHeader class is to parse & tokenize the HTTP header received from client and store these tokens. 
 	* This helps in multiple way :
 		1. To reliably extract the url from the HTTP Header.
 		2. To Validitate the HTTP Header (check its correctness) and generate respective errors.
 		3. Construct a new header in a consistent manner.

III. socket_util.c & socket_util.h 
	* This file is the collection of utility functions which have been used in the proxy.cpp file to DEAL WITH SOCKETS.

<div class="left"><p>The Department of Mathematics IIT Guwahati from its very inception in 1995
has aimed to be a center of excellence in mathematics and
computing and been vigorously engaged in both research and teaching.
The vision of the department is not only to transform young people to
competent and motivated professionals but also to contribute to the
development of the nation, particularly the North-East, through
research, consultancy and training activities. The department has at
present 32 energetic and dedicated faculty members, and has a good number of
distinguished mathematicians visiting it every year. The department has its
own state-of-the-art computing laboratory and also houses the National
Board of Higher Mathematics (NBHM) Regional Library.
The department has also been actively engaged in organizing conferences, workshops, QIP
short term courses and Mathematics Training and Talent Search Programme (MTTS).</p>
<br />
<p>Having started the PhD programme in 1996, the department commenced a
2-year M.Sc. programme in Mathematics and Computing in 2000.
From the academic year 2006-2007, the department has
started a unique 4-year B.Tech. programme in Mathematics and Computing,the first of its kind in the country.
The department also supports the engineering departments
by offering core and advance courses in mathematics at the undergraduate
B.Tech. level in various semesters.</p>
